Steps so far to get the bluetooth to work on device.
1. connect to device open REPL
2. import ubluetooth
3. from ubluetooth import BLE
4. bt = BLE()
5. bt.active(True)  #or bt.active(1) doesnt matter which way you do it
        |----> if this prints back "Gap procedure initiated: stop advertising" try it again
                we want to see only "True" printed back
# the value for below is in microseconds to stop advertising set to 'None'
# can add a str param after for adv_data , str for resp_data, and bool for connectable
# BLE.gap_advertise(interval_us, adv_data, resp_data, connectable)
# have yet to confirm this is working, used nrf connect app for android but haven't seen the device advertise
6. bt.gap_advertise(100000)
        |-----> I used NRF connect android app to scan for bluetooth. I was able to see the device advertising
                it will say N/A as we haven't programmed any information to advertise. Just make sure you know what all the other devices are to decipher which is dev board.
7. bt.active(0) #now you should see the device removed from the list.
8. repeat steps 5 & 6 and yo should see it in the list again.



Notes
need to research more and most likely will have to develop our own firmware to work with device
as it stands some bluetooth functions work yet, for our implementation we want to set the bluetooth always on
and set to advertise so we can pair with our webapp without having to manual set anything on the dev board to get
the bluetooth to work.
