Initial Procedure for loading the micro python firmware onto esp32 for linux

1. Download the esptool - pip install esptool
2. Hold down the boot button on the board and type into terminal:
   sudo esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash
3. After the erase task finishes open a terminal in folder with the firmware image
4. Type the following into the terminal:
        sudo esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 esp32-idf4-20191124-v1.11-586-g1530fda9c.bin
   Note - you may need to hold down the boot button for the above process as well.
5. After the firmware is written into flash, you can now connect to the device and access its REPL.
6. You can use putty on linux serial /dev/ttyUSB0 with baud rate of 115200
   I used picocom through terminal picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
